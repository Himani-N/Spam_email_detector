Requirements for Your Project

Your project uses:

Flask – for the web app

pandas – for loading/manipulating the dataset

scikit-learn – for Naive Bayes and vectorizing text

nltk – for stopwords and text preprocessing

Optional (but sometimes useful):

Werkzeug – comes with Flask, used internally

Jinja2 – Flask template engine (comes with Flask)

Step 1: Create requirements.txt

Create a file named requirements.txt in your project folder and paste this content:

Flask==2.3.3
pandas==2.1.1
scikit-learn==1.3.0
nltk==3.9.1
Werkzeug==2.3.7
Jinja2==3.1.2


Explanation:

Flask==2.3.3 → the main web framework

pandas==2.1.1 → for CSV handling (spam.csv)

scikit-learn==1.3.0 → for Naive Bayes and CountVectorizer

nltk==3.9.1 → for stopwords preprocessing

Werkzeug and Jinja2 → Flask dependencies (ensure smooth running)

Step 2: Install Dependencies

After cloning your repo or sharing it, to install all dependencies on a new machine, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


This will automatically install all the libraries your project needs.

Step 3 (Optional): Check Installed Versions

You can check versions after installing:

pip show flask pandas scikit-learn nltk

Pro Tip

Don’t include unnecessary libraries like matplotlib if you’re not using them — keeps your project lightweight.

Using exact versions ensures your project works exactly the same for anyone else.
